        <h1>Futura vs Mr. Eaves</h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Futura 1927</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>
				Futura, a sans-serif typeface known for its clean geometric shape, was designed by German typographer Paul Renner. Futura's design aligns with the Bauhaus aesthetic, but Renner himself wasn't part of the Bauhaus movement. He shared a lot of similar ideas about fonts reflecting a modern style, and the font was released commercially in 1927, by the Bauer Type Foundry in Frankfurt, Germany. Built on basic geometric forms like circles, squares, and triangles, the shape of Futura’s design displays a sense of order and precision. Letters like "O," "E," and "H" in the font set showcase this geometric influence heavily. The thickness of the strokes in each letterform is nearly uniform throughout, and this can effectively create a consistent and streamlined look to your design. The clean lines and lack of ornamentation make Futura highly versatile, allowing it to work well for headlines, branding, and body text due to its clarity and neutrality.

			 <h3>Mr. Eaves 2009</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p> Mr Eaves is also a sans-serif typeface but is inspired by classic serif fonts that have slightly more organic shapes and subtle variations in stroke thickness. Created by Zuzana Licko, Mr. Eaves was published sometime in 2009 as the sans-serif companion to one of her company’s classic typeface designs, Mrs Eaves. Due to its less structured shape and more humanist touch, Mr Eave displays a friendlier, more approachable feel that allows for a wider variety of uses compared to Futura's starkness. This font is more suitable for lengthy text settings since the larger x-height maintains superior readability at smaller point sizes. Mr Eaves has some distinctive features that set it apart from the more typical sans-serifs. The letters "v," "w," and "z" have a more flamboyant shape, and some strokes have a slight curvature for a touch of personality. Overall, Mr Eaves font design offers a unique blend of classic serif influences and modern sans-serif functionality.
