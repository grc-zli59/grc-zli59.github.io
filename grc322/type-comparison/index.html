        <h1>Futura vs Mr. Eaves</h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Futura 1927</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>
			Futura, a sans-serif typeface known for its clean geometric shape, was designed by German typographer Paul Renner between the years of 1924 and 1926. Futura's design aligns with the Bauhaus aesthetic, but Renner himself wasn't part of the Bauhaus movement. He shared a lot of similar ideas about fonts reflecting a modern style, and the font was released commercially in 1927, by the Bauer Type Foundry in Frankfurt, Germany. Futura was born into the time of Nazi Germany, where even typography was heavily patrolled. In 1934, the Nazis declared that all German visual identity would be produced in German Gothic, the font used in Mein Kampf, one reminiscent of German folklore and cultural history. This typographic conflict was most clearly seen in the city of Hanover between 1920 to 1940. Going into 1930, the city’s visual identity was originally branded using Futura, but after the Nazis came into power, everything was rebranded in German Gothic. However, Hitler made the abrupt decision to ban Gothic typeface in 1941, claiming it to be “Jewish typography”. Some note that this change was made out of necessity, since the use of Gothic typography made Nazi propaganda illegible. Nazi communications then turned back to Renner’s work, and began using Futura for graphic communication. That being said, Renner was an extreme anti-Nazi, which put him in a strange situation. After the war, Futura was able to break away from its past and went on to shape the identity of many brands. Built on basic geometric forms like circles, squares, and triangles, the shape of Futura’s design displays a sense of order and precision. Letters like "O," "E," and "H" in the font set showcase this geometric influence heavily. The thickness of the strokes in each letterform is nearly uniform throughout, and this can effectively create a consistent and streamlined look to your design. The clean lines and lack of ornamentation make Futura highly versatile, allowing it to work well for headlines, branding, and body text due to its clarity and neutrality.

			 <h3>Mr. Eaves 2009</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p> 
				Mr Eaves is also a sans-serif typeface but is inspired by classic serif fonts that have slightly more organic shapes and subtle variations in stroke thickness. Created by Zuzana Licko, Mr. Eaves was published sometime in 2009 as the sans-serif companion to one of her company’s classic typeface designs, Mrs Eaves. Due to its less structured shape and more humanist touch, Mr Eave displays a friendlier, more approachable feel that allows for a wider variety of uses compared to Futura's starkness. This font is more suitable for lengthy text settings since the larger x-height maintains superior readability at smaller point sizes. Mr Eaves has some distinctive features that set it apart from the more typical sans-serifs. The letters "v," "w," and "z" have a more flamboyant shape, and some strokes have a slight curvature for a touch of personality. Overall, Mr Eaves font design offers a unique blend of classic serif influences and modern sans-serif functionality.

			<h2>Font Comparison</h2>
			<h3>Addressing Similarities</h3>
			<p>
				Both Futura and Mr. Eaves belong to the sans-serif typeface category which means they lack serifs. decorative strokes at the ends of their letterforms. This characteristic contributes to a clean and modern aesthetic in both fonts. They both also primarily focus on the Latin alphabet, making them more suitable for most Western languages. While they have distinct personalities, both fonts offer a degree of versatility. Futura's clean lines can work well for minimalist designs, while Mr. Eaves' humanist touch can be appropriate for more approachable or friendly applications, and they both prioritize legibility and clarity, making them suitable for various text sizes and applications where readability is crucial.

			<h3>Mr. Eaves</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->
			<p>
				Overall, we could not find widespread content expressly featuring Mr. Eaves XL Modern, most of the design work we found focused on Mrs. Eaves, as it is the older typeface in the family. We also could not find logos associated with Mr. Eaves.
