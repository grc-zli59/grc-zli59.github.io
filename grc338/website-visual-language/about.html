                        <p>Bread Scooter is a small San Luis Obispo based organic bakery that bakes 100% organic naturally leavened bread and California style pastries with fresh milled whole grains and locally sourced ingredients and delivers them to their Community Supported Bakery members by scooter in San Luis Obispo, California. Through our work we strive to cultivate, educate, and inspire an inclusive community that cares about their food, their farmers, their planet, and each other.</p>
                        <p>We are an organic bakery with a focus on whole grains and seasonal ingredients. We make our bread using a natural leaven (sourdough) that we made ourselves many years ago. Our loaves go through a long, slow fermentation overnight at low temperatures. This process yields a well-fermented loaf that is much easier to digest and more nutritious. Our California-style pastries are made with a focus on seasonal fruit grown locally. We try to find balance in our creations so they are wholesome, comforting, and sustaining.</p>
                        <p>We strive to source the highest quality ingredients that are grown locally and responsibly. Both our whole grain wheat and bread flour is grown here in California. We source whole grain kernels to mill fresh every week in our stone mill from small scale organic farmers around California. We supplement our whole grain sourcing with milled flour and seeds from Community Grains and Central Milling. All of our dairy and butter comes from Straus Family Creamery. We are always interested in learning about and working with regional growers so please connect us with any you may know of!</p>
                        <p>Thank you always for your support and welcome to the Bread Scooter community. We’re here to serve you and spread that special sort of happiness that only comes from ripping into a fresh, crusty loaf of bread after a long day…or really just any time of any day :)</p>
